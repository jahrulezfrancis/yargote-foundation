    description: `
    In November 2024, Yargote Foundation hosted the first edition of the Empower the Boy Child Summit, bringing together parents, educators, community leaders, and young boys who share a common dream of building a brighter future for the boy child.

    The summit created a warm and engaging space for open conversations about the challenges boys face and the collective role society can play in supporting them. Participants shared experiences, exchanged ideas, and listened to heartfelt talks that emphasized mentorship, discipline, and emotional growth.

    The gathering was filled with energy, learning, and a deep sense of community. Parents and guardians came out in large numbers to show their support, while young boys listened with curiosity and enthusiasm, eager to learn and be inspired. The summit became more than just an event — it became a movement that reminded everyone that empowering boys is essential for building balanced and thriving communities.

    As we look forward to the next edition, our commitment remains firm. The upcoming summit will build on this strong foundation, introducing new opportunities to educate, guide, and inspire.

    At Yargote Foundation, we believe every boy deserves to be seen, heard, and supported as he grows into a responsible and confident young man.`,

    description: `The Yargote Foundation recently hosted a powerful mentorship session with Ahmed Buhari, a respected leader, entrepreneur, and former presidential candidate. It was an inspiring day filled with stories, lessons, and reflections that left a lasting impression on everyone who attended.

    During the session, Mr. Buhari spoke passionately about purpose, leadership, and the importance of self-belief. He encouraged the young participants to embrace education, discipline, and hard work as tools for creating a meaningful life. His words were not just motivational but deeply practical, drawn from his own experiences in business and public service.

    The boys listened with keen attention as he shared the importance of integrity and community involvement. He reminded them that true leadership begins with the choices they make every day — how they treat others, how they manage their time, and how they stay focused on their goals.

    It was a day of connection and inspiration. Many participants left the room feeling renewed, with a clearer sense of direction and a stronger belief in what they can achieve. The session reflected one of Yargote Foundation’s core values: building confident, informed, and purposeful young men who will shape a better future for their communities.

    At Yargote Foundation, we remain grateful to Ahmed Buhari for sharing his time and wisdom, and for believing in the power of mentorship. Moments like this remind us why we do what we do — to open minds, build confidence, and light the path for tomorrow’s leaders.`,

    excerpt: "In a world where the challenges of the boy child are often overlooked, the Yargote Foundation is quietly rewriting a powerful story, one of hope, guidance, and transformation.",

    content: "In a world where the challenges of the boy child are often overlooked, the Yargote Foundation is quietly rewriting a powerful story, one of hope, guidance, and transformation. At a recent Boy Child Training Program, dozens of young boys gathered with eager faces, some shy, some curious, and others simply grateful to be seen. Many of them come from backgrounds where support is scarce, where dreams often fade before they begin. But for a moment, in that small classroom and open community space, they found something different: a place where they mattered. \nThe program, designed to empower boys with essential life skills, mentorship, and values, was more than just a training, it was a life-changing experience. Under the warm guidance of Yargote Foundation facilitators, the boys learned about leadership, discipline, respect, and the power of believing in themselves. Each session was filled with energy, laughter, and heartfelt conversations. They shared their stories, listened to mentors who understood their struggles, and began to see new possibilities for their future. At the end of the day, every boy left with a Yargote Foundation Reality Kit, a simple but meaningful package symbolizing a new beginning, filled not just with educational materials, but with hope.One could see it in their eyes, the spark of realization that they, too, could become tomorrow’s leaders, innovators, and changemakers.Through this initiative, the Yargote Foundation continues to stand firm in its mission to empower, educate, and uplift. The foundation believes that when we invest in boys today, we're not just shaping individuals, we're building stronger men, families, and communities for tomorrow. This training is not the end of the journey, but the beginning of many more stories of transformation that Yargote Foundation aims to nurture across Nigeria and beyond. Because when a boy is guided, believed in, and given the tools to thrive, he grows into a man who helps the world heal.",

    content: `The Yargote Foundation set the tone for the International Day of the Boy Child 2025 with a vibrant 3-kilometer road walk through the heart of Abuja, Nigeria. The event shone a spotlight on the often-overlooked challenges faced by boys, especially those in unreachable or conflict-affected communities.

    Held at Millennium Park, the walk brought together boys dressed in white tees emblazoned with the “Boy Walk” logo and green wristbands, a symbol of unity, hope, and resilience. Supporters joined in, carrying signs with messages like “Listen to Him, The Boy Child Has a Voice” and “The Boy Child is Not a Threat, He Needs Support.”

    Speaking at the event, Executive Director Anna Hussaini Pai emphasized the importance of raising awareness around boys’ wellbeing, from educational neglect to mental health stigma, particularly in marginalized areas.

    The campaign focused on reaching the “unreachable boys”, those living in remote or underserved communities who need access to mentorship, skills development, and emotional support.

    Sponsors such as CWAY and Taronic Scents showed their commitment to the cause, reinforcing that empowering boys requires a collective effort from every part of society.

    The event concluded with smiles, cheers, and a powerful image, a young boy proudly holding his “International Boy Child Day 2025” sign, embodying the day’s message of hope, visibility, and belonging.

    Together, we continue to raise the boy , one step, one voice, and one story at a time.`,

    At Yargote Foundation, we believe that learning should never be limited by walls or circumstances. This belief came alive in a powerful way during one of our regular class sessions when the security personnel didn’t open the classroom on time.

    Instead of letting that setback stop them, our boys decided to take their lessons outdoors. With notebooks in hand and determination on their faces, they gathered under the open sky to continue learning. It was a beautiful reminder that education is not about a building—it’s about the will to grow, learn, and share knowledge wherever you are.

    Moments like these reflect the spirit of resilience and commitment we hope to instill in every child we support. These boys remind us daily that when passion meets purpose, no locked door can stop progress.

    We are inspired at Yargote foundation to keep providing access, encouragement, and the resources needed to nurture such unbreakable spirits.`,

    content: `In a powerful display of community spirit, the Yargote Foundation organized a “Community Cleaning in Kabusa” initiative, a hands-on exercise aimed at teaching young boys the value of cleanliness, responsibility, and giving back to their environment.

    Wearing black Yargote Foundation tees and protective gloves, the boys came together to clean their surroundings, sweeping, gathering waste, and restoring order to public spaces. The activity wasn’t just about keeping Kabusa clean; it was about instilling discipline, teamwork, and leadership in the next generation of young men.

    Guided by Yargote Foundation volunteers, the boys learned that community development starts with personal responsibility. Each broom stroke and bag of collected waste symbolized their growing understanding that every small act of service contributes to a greater good.

    Beyond the cleaning, the day was filled with laughter, teamwork, and unity, a reminder that empowering boys goes beyond words; it’s about helping them take action that impacts their communities.

    Through this initiative, Yargote Foundation continues its mission to raise boys who are confident, compassionate, and community-minded, shaping them into responsible citizens ready to build a cleaner and stronger society.`,
